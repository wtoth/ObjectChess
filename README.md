# ObjectChess
 
 Hi! Welcome to ObjectChess by Billy Toth\
 This is a chess game library with an attached Console Player. The Console Player is rudimentary in aesthetics but allows you to play a full game of chess!\
 The Library is also used to power a forthcoming web based version of the game. 
 
 ## Getting Started
 Make sure you have visual studio and C#/dotnet7 downloaded.\ 
 From here you should be able to just build and run the app launching you into the cli based game.
